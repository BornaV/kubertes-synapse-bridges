# Usage
before deployment, it would be recommended to comment out all commands from all containers and let it run once to generate default configs for all the containers, after which the data of the configs should be stored inside of the config maps for the respective containers and uncommenting the command and deleting the autogenerated config
If there is an existing config it will not be overwritten by the config map so for any changes to occur, it would be necessary to delete the file or change the Command field accordingly
